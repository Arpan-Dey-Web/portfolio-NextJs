          I am Arpan Dey, a dedicated developer who embraces new technologies
          with calm confidence. My programming journey began with HTML and CSS
          experiments, growing into a passion for building responsive,
          user-friendly web applications using JavaScript, ReactJS, and the MERN
          stack. I love transforming complex ideas into clean, intuitive designs
          and enjoy collaborating to deliver efficient, visually engaging
          solutions. From integrating APIs to fine-tuning animations, I focus on
          creating seamless digital experiences that feel effortless to use.
          Beyond coding, I recharge by exploring food spots, playing cricket,
          and capturing life through photographyâ€”hobbies that fuel my creativity
          and fresh perspective. Guided by curiosity and persistence, I see
          every project as a chance to innovate and make technology more human.
